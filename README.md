=============

A repo to hold the XML the [FCC released]. 

Note that the datasets are in the data directory and are gzipped. You might ask
yourself, why are they gzipped? git is made to compress and send the txt/source
files in the best way! 

well. Github has file limits my friend, and 100MB of data is it and we can't go
past that. Also, my internet connection kicks out when trying to push things that
are more than 70MB or so up to the cloud. So therefore, you get gzipped fileds. 
To unzip them simply use the `gzip -d` command.
